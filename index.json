Active patches for each AU are selected more specificity by group sparsity learning.

Compared with patch learning based and multi-label learning based algorithms separately, JPML obtained the best predictions across three datasets.","tags":null,"title":"Joint Patch and Multi-label Learning for Facial Action Unit Detection","type":"publication"}]
